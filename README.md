# Clippic
A tiny (11kb) portable single executable that allows the user to take a screenshot of a selection on the screen
and saves it in the clipboard. It works relatively similar to tools like Gyazo.

## Features
- Screenshots (yes, really!)
- Support for multiple monitors
- A sound effect (can be disabled by using the `-nosound` program argument)
